- test local API between flask server - downloadable KNIME
- chem similarity searcher 
- expanding services - with chembl database? pre-calculate fingerprints
- capture as v1 -> v1.1, v1.2...
- IUCLID/toolbox would constitute version change
- surface chembl within this platform 
- QSAR model - accompany with nearest neighbour in training set - user can verify their expert judgment 

- overengineering vs building out platform
- next steps:
- build services to explore different ways to manipulate and visualise data
- rendering functionality -> how to handle PIL objects?
- questions going forward:
- how to accept chemical data? manipulate data? visualise data? 
- accepting chemical in draw box?
- other than SMILES strings - CAS number/IUPAC names
- sending data to KNIME workflow - how and is this possible? 
- visualisation? molecular clusters, fingerprints? - creates image highlighting substructures
- hover over structure and highlight
- similarity search - takes in SMILES and in backend calculates similarity scores - returns image - substructures
- retain input/output - 1 nearest neighbour - experiment with visualisation 
- explore Py3DMol as upgrade to the Ames predictor


11.10.24

- discuss libraries with ITD - JS nodes
- exposure models as additional module - in Excel format
    - Anna sending link
    - macros
    - exposure models
- how to make it easy to input data? template for users to populate -> enhance complexity of input forms
- ChemTunes - API for similarity search
    - set up meeting with ChemTunes?
- next steps
    - scope out exposure models - no date but higher priority
    - API investigation - which available? - ongoing
        - list of tools for integration
        - what documentation is available?
        - identify unique functions
        - which are easiest to work with/most accessible
    - add to Planner
    - KNIME grouping approach - API/server
    - azos datasets
    - cheminformatics toolkits suggested by Panos e.g. Indigo 
    - EPT
        - when/how would be onboarded?
        - feeds back to data curation tools - how to automate
    - High hazard list
    - Map data to IUCLID - custom workflows
    - OECD end uses - ask Marat for latest copy
    - complex substances
    - cloud platform - catch-up before end of October 
        - most suitable candidate
        - $500 max spend for quick turnaround
        - estimate per month or year
        - machine learning stream -
